## Coding Projects

### 1 Unsupervised ML: High Value Customers Identification

**Keywords:**
unsupervised machine learning, clustering, KMeans, elbowology, efficacy comparison

**Self-defined Functions:** `recompute_centers`, `my_kmeans`, `calculate_within_cluster_sse`, `looping_kmeans_sklearn`, `looping_kmeans_my`

This is a revision of hw2.

The dataset used in this project is the [UK-High value Customers Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/vik2012kvs/high-value-customers-identification) dataset. In this coding project, I will use k-means to segment customers into clusters and identify the group of high-value customers--customers who are loyal to the brand or make high purchases--for a UK-based online retail store. In this project, I will use KMeans to segment customers into clusters. I will use elbowology to choose the best number of clusters and will compare efficacy of my own "cold" implementation of KMeans and the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.




### 2 Customer Segmentation on the Credit Card Dataset (Unsupervised)

**Keywords:** unsupervised machine learning, clustering, hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, KMeans

**Self-defined Functions:** `replace_null_mean`

The dataset used in this project is [Credit Card Dataset for Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).

Credit card users also have different behaviors. This credit card dataset contains usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders in last 6 months1. The task here is to segment credit card users into clusters based on their different behaviors. In this project, I will try different strategies to segment the credit holders and find the model that makes the most sense. I will try hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, and KMeans.




### 3 Supervised ML: Company Bankruptcy Prediction

**Keywords:**
supervised machine learning, classification, ensemble method, random forest, cross-validation

**Self-defined Functions:** `split_val_data`, `random_forest_cross_val`

The dataset used in this project is the [Company Bankruptcy Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction) dataset, which is a Bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999â€“2009. My goal is to train a random forest model to predict whether a business will go bankrupt. I will use PCA to reduce the dimension of the dataset. I will use cross-validation to choose the best hyperparameters for the random forest model and then fit a model with the "best" set of hyperparameters.
